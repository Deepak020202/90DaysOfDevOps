# #90DaysOfDevOps 🚀

Welcome to my **#90DaysOfDevOps challenge!** 🎯  
This is a personal journey where I commit to learning, practicing, and mastering various DevOps tools and concepts over a span of 90 days. The goal is to build a strong foundation, share progress with the community.
## 📌 Why #90DaysOfDevOps?

DevOps is not just a toolset – it's a mindset. Over the next 90 days, I aim to:

- 🧠 Learn core DevOps practices and principles
- 🛠️ Get hands-on with popular tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and more
- ☁️ Understand CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring, and cloud deployments (AWS-focused)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop strong problem-solving and automation skills
- Build a real-world DevOps project using everything I’ve learned
- Connect with the DevOps community and gain feedback

## 📅 Challenge start from 
**Feb 2025**
